Data Description: An imaginary chain of bicycle stores ("Two Wheels") collected various demographic data on the customers that entered their stores such as age, gender, income, commute distance, home and car ownership, etc.  (see "working" worksheet for raw data collected)
Analysis Goals: The Two Wheels executives aim to gain deeper insights into the characteristics of customers who choose to purchase bicycles from their stores.
Project Goals:  To showcase Excel skills in data cleaning, data transformations (e.g. binary encoding, binning), creating pivot charts and building interactive dashboards for presentation and further analysis.
Process: 
1) Data Cleaning: removing duplicate rows, creating more meaningful data entries, handling missing values, typos and spelling mistakes
2) Data Exploration and Transformations:  As this is a small dataset,  the statistical analysis done was limited.  Basic statistical measures such as averages, counts and sums were computed.  Data Transformations included binary encoding and binning for more useful analysis of numerical variables such as age, income, and number of cars.  Line graphs were created for identifying potential correlations among variables such as income and the likelihood of purchasing a bike.   Further analysis of gender, car ownership, age, commute distance and other factors were explored to determine their effect on bike sales
3) Creation of pivot tables and their associated charts to further explore and highlight findings
4) Creation of a interactive dashboard with slicers
5) Summarize Findings:
**(caveat: not a "real-world" bike company, see data source above)
a) Commute Distance was a dominant factor in bike purchases for the global set of customers under the age of 55, especially in the European region.
b) Gender is not a strong contributing factor for predicting whether a customer will purchase a bike
c) The majority of customers purchasing a bike are within the 35-54 age range
d) Annual income does not play a large factor in determing whether a customer will purchase a bike.
e) Car Ownership: Of the set of customers that do NOT own a car, 61% of them purchased a bike as compared to 44% of the car owning customer population.  **NOTE: this graph "works" but if delivering to a client I probably would relabel the 0/1 field as yes/no in regards to car ownership
